🥗 Ingreva

Ingredient intelligence, personalized.

Ingreva is an AI-powered nutrition co-pilot that helps users understand food ingredients, make better eating decisions, and track their nutrition based on their personal goals and daily context.

Unlike traditional food apps that label food as simply “good” or “bad,” Ingreva evaluates food relative to the user — what they want to achieve and what they’ve already eaten.

🚀 What Ingreva Does

Explains food ingredients in simple, human language

Gives a personalized health score (0–100) for each product

Adjusts scores based on what the user has already eaten that day

Logs food consumption automatically

Shows daily and weekly nutrition summaries

Adapts recommendations over time as user habits change

Ingreva is designed to reduce confusion, avoid fear-mongering, and encourage balance instead of restriction.

🧠 Core Idea

The same food can be good for one person, bad for another, and change value throughout the day.

Ingreva scores food in context, not in isolation.

What you eat earlier affects what’s recommended later

Each day resets — yesterday doesn’t punish today

Scores are personalized, not universal

✨ Key Features
🧾 Ingredient Explanation

Breaks down complex ingredient lists into clear, calm explanations without technical jargon.

🎯 Personalized Food Scoring

Food is scored based on:

Food preferences and sensitivities

Current day’s nutritional intake

🔄 Context-Aware Scoring

If you’ve already consumed high sugar or calories, similar foods later in the day score lower — encouraging balance.

Translate scientific context into plain English

Adjust food scores based on user goals and daily intake

Communicate uncertainty honestly

The goal is guidance, not judgment.





🙌 Final Note

Ingreva is not about strict diets or calorie obsession.
It’s about understanding food, learning from habits, and making better choices over time.
